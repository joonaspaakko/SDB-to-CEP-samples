A simple panel that populates a dropdownlist with the names of all open documents on reload and on button press.

#### General tidbits

1. Everything that came from the SDB's CEP export is in the `index.html` file.
2. The button movement is controlled by this little snippet at the top of the `index.html` file:
	```CSS
	[data-item-name="fetchBtn"] > div:active {
		margin-top: 2px;
	}
	```
3. The panel works in: `Indesign`, `Illustrator`and `Photoshop`.
4. The name you'll see in the extensions menu is `SDB - Fetch Docs`
