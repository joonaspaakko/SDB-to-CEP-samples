# SDB â†’ CEP export

1. [SDB](https://scriptui.joonas.me)'s CEP export is a little hidden, so if you can't find the CEP export toggle, check out [this gif](CEP-export-option.gif)
2. This sample repo is technically not needed. The CEP export doesn't actually export a whole panel, it simply spews out the layout (html, css and js), that you can place to whatever CEP boilerplate you wish to use. 
    - This sample panel is pretty much just one of the samples from the [Adobe CEP page](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP) under `CEP-resources/CEP_x.x/Samples`. Nothing fancy.

## Documentation

Documentation lives online at [scriptui.joonas.me/docs](https://scriptui.joonas.me/docs). To make it easier to work with the SUI layout, the included JS contains a bunch of helper methods that you can find in the: [CEP section](https://scriptui.joonas.me/docs/CEP-export/getting-started/). Not every single item has these helper methods. You don't need a specific helper method to write a click event to a button, for instance. That would make things too convoluted.

**Note:** pages are on the left sidebar and table of contents on the right sidebar

 > It's also in the [SDB](https://github.com/joonaspaakko/ScriptUI-Dialog-Builder-Joonas) repo in Github under [build/docs](https://github.com/joonaspaakko/ScriptUI-Dialog-Builder-Joonas/tree/master/build/docs).
 
## Issues Errwhere...

If you have any issues, questions or suggestions, you may want to post those over at [the SDB repo/issues](https://github.com/joonaspaakko/ScriptUI-Dialog-Builder-Joonas/issues). 

# SDB.fetch.docs - Sample panel

![](SDB-fetch-docs-preview.png)

A simple panel that populates a dropdownlist with the names of all open documents on reload and on button press. It does also activate documents when you select them in the dropdownlist.

## General tidbits (SDB.fetch.docs)

1. Everything that came from the SDB's CEP export is in the `index.html` file.
2. The button movement is controlled by this little snippet at the top of the `index.html` file:
	```CSS
	[data-item-name="fetchBtn"] > div:active {
		margin-top: 2px;
	}
	```
3. The panel works in: `Indesign`, `Illustrator`and `Photoshop`.
4. The name you'll see in the extensions menu is `SDB - Fetch Docs`

# Theme manager & Interface color example

[SDB](https://scriptui.joonas.me)'s CEP export now has a theme manager that has to be triggered manually. There's not much to it, but you can read more [here](https://scriptui.joonas.me/docs/CEP-export/thememanager/).

How it looks like:
